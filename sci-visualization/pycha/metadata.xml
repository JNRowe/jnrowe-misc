		Pycha is a very simple Python package for drawing charts using the great
		<pkg>x11-libs/cairo</pkg> library. Its goals are:
		
		* Lightweight
		* Simple to use
		* Nice looking with default values
		* Customization

		It won't try to draw any possible chart on earth but draw the most
		common ones nicely. There are some other options you may want to look at
		like pyCairoChart.

		Pycha is based on Plotr which is based on PlotKit. Both libraries are
		written in JavaScript and are great for client web programming. I needed
		the same for the server side so that's the reason I ported Plotr to
		Python. Now we can deliver charts to people with JavaScript disabled or
		embed them in PDF reports.
