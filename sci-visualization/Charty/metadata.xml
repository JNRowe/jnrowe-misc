		Charty is a <pkg>dev-lang/python</pkg> library that generates
		SVG charts that use cascading stylesheets to alter their style
		and appearance. The file example.py included in the project
		includes some example usage for creating bar, line and pie
		charts. In general, you want to pass in height, width, data, css
		file name and other option parameters to the constructor and
		then call the output method to write the svg to a file. Every
		SVG node is classed explicitly and these can be styled as
		necessary. There are example css files in the css folder of the
		project, but below is an explicit description of the classes.
