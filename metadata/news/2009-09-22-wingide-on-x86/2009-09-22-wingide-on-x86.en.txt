Unless somebody with a valid professional key for wingide steps up to
maintain the ebuild for x86 then the x86 keyword will have to be dropped
for new releases.  Nobody with commit, or for that matter direct bug
access, on this overlay who uses wingide has access to x86 hardware to
test releases.

If you don't want to see support for this package dropped now is the
time to speak up, and as always patches are the loudest and most
appreciated voices.
