As of 2014-06-26, the ``jnrowe-misc`` repository is shuttered.  The
environments where I use Gentoo have vanished, and I don't expect any to
arise in the near future.

I plan on maintaining the packages in this overlay for as long as people
report bugs, but won't promise speedy bug resolution.

What this repository really needs is a new maintainer, so if you're
a user it is time to step up!
