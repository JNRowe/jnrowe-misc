The ``jnrowe-misc`` repository has now entered maintenance mode, and
dev-python/schematics will no longer be receiving version bumps.  Bug
fixes may still be applied as time permits.

Feel free to step up and maintain this package if you want to see it
move forward.

Specifically, in the case of ``schematics`` you should be aware that
newer versions are incompatible and a considerable amount of effort
would need to be expended before a bump for this package could be
applied.
