The ``jnrowe-misc`` repository has now entered maintenance mode.

The environments where I use Gentoo have vanished, and are unlikely to
re-appear at any point in the near future.

I'll continue to maintain the packages in this overlay for as long as
possible.  I'm no longer adding new packages, and will probably start to
lag on updates for other less used packages.

.. warning::

   At some point this "maintenance mode" transitions to abandoned, I'll
   post a final update before that happens.
