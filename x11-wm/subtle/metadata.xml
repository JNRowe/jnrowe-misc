		Subtle is a another tiling window manager with a very flexible and
		dynamical layout, client and view tagging, mouse and keyboard control as
		well as an extendable statusbar.

		Subtler (subtle remote) is similar to wmctrl a commandline tool to
		interact with a EWMH/NetWM compatible window manager.

		Sublets (subtle applets) are small programs written in Ruby to add
		features to the statusbar.

		Subtlext (subtle extension) is a Ruby extension that brings the features
		of subtler to Ruby scripts.
