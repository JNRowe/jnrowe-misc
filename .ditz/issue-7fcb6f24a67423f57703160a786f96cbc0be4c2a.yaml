    rudolf appears to give much better colourised output, unfortunately it
    adds 1.5 seconds to the test runner time.  We need some more feedback to
    decide whether the massive time increase is worth the functionality.

    rednose appears to not be able to colourise doctest output correctly,
    which is a serious flaw for my own usage.
