title: Test with layman-1.2.4 changes.
desc: |-
  Apparently, the configuration file format for layman has changed.  Somebody who
  uses layman needs to test whether the layman documentation is still valid, and
  possibly update the layman configuration snippet in support/.

    As Matt is no longer using layman I'm going to work on this bug.  In the future
    layman support may be dropped, as it adds little value for known users of this
    overlay.

    The old format seems to be supported in at least 1.2.4, but we may as well add
    a new definition file as it is little effort.
