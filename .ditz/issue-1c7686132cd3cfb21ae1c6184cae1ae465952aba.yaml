  - The added tools make this a nice alternative to app-office/ledger.

    The problem is there is one released version and it is buggy and very old.  It
    appears the preferred method for installation now is from the mercurial
    repository, and fluid packaging isn't a reasonable choice for something like
    this.
    
    Also, the packaging for beancount is quite broken.  The cost isn't worth the
    effort, so this is being closed as WONTFIX.  Which is a shame as it appeared to
    be a great improvement over ledger on first inspection.
