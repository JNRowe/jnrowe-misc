    There is now a version in the upstream tree, so check its suitability before
    continuing.

    The in-tree version isn't usable as a direct replacement, but I don't want to
    shadow it from within this overlay so it is moving to ::shadowed.  It will be
    maintained there indefinitely, which probably means until somebody else pushes
    fixes upstream(check upstream metadata.xml before putting time in to this).
