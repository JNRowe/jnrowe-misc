title: If freshen pans out drop pycukes and deps.
desc: |-
  The maintenance overhead would be much smaller on freshen, and over

    Currently there is no actual release of freshen, and replacing working
    released software with a live git ebuild isn't a great idea.
    
    That being said freshen does appear to work well, so maybe a snapshot
    would be good enough.
