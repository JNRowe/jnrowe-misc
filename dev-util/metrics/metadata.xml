		The metrics software package was born out of the author's frustration
		about available Open Source metrics packages. There are plenty of them
		so it is not a problem to find one. But each and every of them has
		a different focus. Most metrics packages have restrictions towards
		available metrics and supported languages. Some prominent samples are
		(CCCC, SLOCCount, PyMetrics, Eclipse-Metrics, Ohcount).
