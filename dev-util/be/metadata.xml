    Bugs Everywhere is a “distributed bugtracker”, designed to
    complement distributed revision control systems. By using
    distributed revision control as a backend for bug state, we gain
    several convenient features:
      * Bugs and code that live on branches are tracked together—when
        a branch is merged, both the code changes and bug changes that
        the branch contains are merged alongside each other. We no
        longer have to be confused about whether a fix that is applied
        to the development branch but not yet present in the production
        branch means that our bug is “fixed”.
      * Users can fully modify bug state while offline, unlike with
        many centralized bugtrackers.
      * When a user checks out your source code, she gets the current
        bug state for free.
