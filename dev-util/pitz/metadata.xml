		Pitz is a issue-tracking system with these goals:

		* Your to-do list lives in flat files right next to your code.

		* The to-do list objects (entities) serialize and deserialize to
		  a plain-text format, so that standard diff tools can expose how issues
		  evolved over time and objects can be edited with any editor.

		* You can use your source control system (git, svn, zipped files,
		  whatever) to track history.

		* Entities can hold arbitrary attributes and values. In other words, the
		  user of the library defines what fields to track.

		* Complex queries are straightforward to write.
