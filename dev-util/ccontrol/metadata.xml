		The ccontrol program takes over the roles of the compiler, linker and
		make, and reads a configuration file to decide what to do before
		invoking them. This is particularly useful for centralized control over
		commands and options, such as enabling <pkg>sys-devel/distcc</pkg> and
		<pkg>dev-util/ccache</pkg>. It is also great for controlling parallelism
		and which compiler versions to use, based on the directory and make
		targets.
