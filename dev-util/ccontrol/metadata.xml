		The ccontrol program takes over the roles of the compiler, linker and
		make, and reads a configuration file to decide what to do before
		invoking them. This is particularly useful for centralized control over
		commands and options, such as enabling distcc and ccache. It is also
		great for controlling parallelism and which compiler versions to use,
		based on the directory and make targets.
