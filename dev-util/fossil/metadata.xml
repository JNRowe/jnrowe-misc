		What makes Fossil worthy of attention?

		Bug Tracking And Wiki - In addition to doing distributed version
		control like Git and Mercurial, Fossil also supports distributed bug
		tracking and distributed wiki all in a single integrated package.

		Web Interface - Fossil has a built-in and easy-to-use web interface that
		simplifies project tracking and promotes situational awareness. Simply
		type "fossil ui" from within any check-out and Fossil automatically
		opens your web browser in a page that gives detailed history and status
		information on that project.

		Autosync - Fossil supports "autosync" mode which helps to keep projects
		moving forward by reducing the amount of needless forking and merging
		often associated distributed projects.

		Self-Contained - Fossil is a single stand-alone executable that contains
		everything needed to do configuration management. Installation is
		trivial: simply download a precompiled binary for Linux, Mac, or Windows
		and put it on your $PATH. Easy-to-compile source code is available for
		users on other platforms. Fossil sources are also mostly self-contained,
		requiring only the "zlib" library and the standard C library to build.

		Simple Networking - Fossil uses plain old HTTP (with proxy support) for
		all network communications, meaning that it works fine from behind
		restrictive firewalls. The protocol is bandwidth efficient to the point
		that Fossil can be used comfortably over a dial-up internet connection.

		CGI Enabled - No server is required to use fossil. But a server does
		make collaboration easier. Fossil supports three different yet simple
		server configurations. The most popular is a 2-line CGI script. This is
		the approach used by the self-hosting fossil repositories.

		Robust &amp; Reliable - Fossil stores content in an SQLite database so
		that transactions are atomic even if interrupted by a power loss or
		system crash. Furthermore, automatic self-checks verify that all aspects
		of the repository are consistent prior to each commit. In over two years
		of operation, no work has ever been lost after having been committed to
		a Fossil repository.
