    Ditz is a simple, light-weight distributed issue tracker designed
    to work with distributed version control systems like git, darcs,
    Mercurial, and Bazaar. It can also be used with centralized
    systems like SVN.

    Ditz features a simple, clean commandline interface, a robust
    plugin architecture which allows for adding commands and
    extending model fields and ditz output, a human-editable file
    format, and an active developer community.

    Ditz also provides static HTML generation capabilities for
    producing world-readable status pages (for a demo, see the ditz
    ditz page). It currently offers no central public method of bug
    submission.
