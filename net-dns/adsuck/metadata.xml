		adsuck is a small DNS server that spoofs blacklisted addresses and
		forwards all other queries. The idea is to be able to prevent
		connections to undesirable sites such as ad servers, crawlers and other
		nasties. It can be used locally, for the road warrior, or on the network
		perimeter in order to protect machines from malicious sites. It also has
		the capability to match website names using regex and there is also
		a mechanism to spoof DNS queries to specified IP addresses.
