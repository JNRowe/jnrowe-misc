misc-overlay
============

Packages that don't naturally fit in to my other themed overlays.

If you find any problems with ebuilds in this overlay either drop me an
email_ or file an issue_.  Locally bugs are managed with `Bugs
Everywhere`_, so if you're working with a clone of the repository you
can report, list and fix bugs using ``dev-util/be``.
