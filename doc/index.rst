   contain the root `toctree` directive.

``jnrowe-misc`` - Gentoo overlay
=================================

``jnrowe-misc`` is for packages that don't naturally fit in to one of my other
themed overlays.  You'll find a large selection of Python_ packages, a few
awesome_ plugins, some tools to make working with git_ more fun and various
other tools I can't live without.

If you find any problems with an ``ebuild`` in this overlay either file an
issue_ or drop me an email_.

.. warning::

   This repository uses thin manifests, which requires a moderately recent
   version of ``portage`` to function correctly(2.1.10.18 or newer).  Using
   older versions is not supported!

This documentation reflects the overlay state as of |today|.
