   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

``misc-overlay`` - Gentoo overlay
=================================

``misc-overlay`` is for packages that don't naturally fit in to one of my other
themed overlays.  You'll find a large selection of Python_ packages, a few
awesome_ plugins, some tools to make working with git_ more fun and various
other tools I can't live without.

If you find any problems with an ``ebuild`` in this overlay either file an
issue_ or drop me an email_.

This documentation reflects the overlay state as of |today|.
