``Cake`` usage
==============

:pypi:`cake` is used for many of the repetitive and maintenance-related tasks in
this overlay.  It was chosen over :command:`make` as the :file:`Makefile` was
simply becoming too unwieldy, and as many of the support tools were already
written in Python_ ``cake`` seemed like a good choice.
