Dead packages
=============

This page lists packages that have been removed from this overlay for various
reasons.  You can use it to find pointers to their new locations for moved
packages, or perhaps to find the last available ``ebuild`` if they were simply
culled.

.. warning::

   This document is *almost* entirely generated using ``git show``.  If an entry
   doesn't make sense take a look at the referenced commit for the full context.

    This one was a very, very, very long time coming...

    This can't be handled by just moving the current ``ebuild`` to ``::fixes``,
    as the upgrade path is fiercely ugly.  The shadowed ``ebuild`` is expected
    to be around for quite some time still.

    There is now a version in the tree, and the ``ebuilds`` will still exist in
    ``::fixes`` until a version has equivalent keywords.  See the linked bug for
    some unfortunate details of the upgrade path.

``vicious``

    Users should have migrated to the new upstream ``ebuilds``, but the upgrade
