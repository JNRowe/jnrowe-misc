		The freedesktop.org Desktop Notifications Specification provides
		a standard way for applications to display pop-up notifications. These
		are designed to make you aware of something, without interrupting your
		work with a window you must close.

		Notify OSD presents these notifications as ephemeral overlays, which can
		be clicked through so they don't block your work. It queues
		notifications, to prevent them from flooding your screen. And as well as
		handling standard notification updates, Notify OSD introduces the idea
		of appending â€” allowing notifications to grow over time, for example in
		the case of instant messages from a particular person.
