		Wirbel is a new programming language. It has a syntax and semantics
		similar to Python - a very popular language invented by Guido van
		Rossum. But - unlike Python - Wirbel is a compiler language
		compiling into native machine code.

		This has two great advantages (and several minor ones):
		* Wirbel programs execute very fast.
		* Compiled Wirbel programs do not need any runtime
		environment - not even a library.

		These two key features make Wirbel a very interesting language in
		many situations. The lack of the need for a runtime environment
		does not only save memory but also makes life easier when
		distributing your software. And speed almost always matters.
