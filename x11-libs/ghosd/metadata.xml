		Ghosd is a library for flashing information to the screen in an
		attractive manner. The venerable XOSD has served many well, but I wanted
		something that looks flashier. To that end, Ghosd supports:
		
			* (pseudo-)transparency, which means not only unneccessary graphical 
			  effects but also antialiased edges on fonts;
			* Pango for high-quality text layout and rendering;
			* Cairo for nice 2D graphics.

		It's a tiny amount of code and available under the MIT license.
