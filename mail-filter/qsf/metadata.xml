		Quick Spam Filter (QSF) is an Open Source email classification
		filter, designed to be small, fast, and accurate, which works to
		classify incoming email as either spam or non-spam.

		To recognise spam, QSF strips the text out of the email (using
		MIME decoding and HTML stripping) and then splits it into tokens
		(words, word pairs, URLs, and so on). These tokens are then
		looked up in a database and analysed using the Bayesian technique
		to see whether the email should be classified as spam or not.
