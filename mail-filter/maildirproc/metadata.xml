		maildirproc is a program that processes one or several existing mail
		boxes in the maildir format. It is primarily focused on mail sorting
		â€” i.e., moving, copying, forwarding and deleting mail according to a set
		of rules. It can be seen as an alternative to procmail, but instead of
		being a delivery agent (which wants to be part of the delivery chain),
		maildirproc only processes already delivered mail. And that's a feature,
		not a bug.
