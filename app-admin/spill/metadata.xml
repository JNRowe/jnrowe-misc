		spill is a program for creating set of symbolic links from one directory
		hierarchy which point to corresponding filenames in a separate directory
		hierarchy. It's primary use is to allow packages built from source to be
		installed in separate directory trees, which are all linked together
		under a common directory tree (e.g. /usr/local) to reduce the length of
		the PATH environment variable.
