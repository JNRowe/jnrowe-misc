		You install ( often with GNU Make ) your software into a repository
		directory ( often /stow or /usr/local/stow. ) You tell Stow where you
		want your software to belong and Stow safely symbolically links it
		there. Stow doesn't install or remove your software - it only makes or
		removes symbolic links to your software, which always remains in the
		repository.
