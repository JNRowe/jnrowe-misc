This End User License Agreement (EULA) is a CONTRACT between you (either
an individual or a single entity) and Wingware, which covers your use of either
"Wing IDE Professional" or "Wing IDE Enterprise" and related software components.
All such software is referred to herein as the "Software Product." A software
license and a license key or serial number ("Software Product License"),
issued to a designated user only by Wingware or its authorized
agents, is required for each concurrent user of the Software Product. If
you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, then do not install or use
the Software Product or the Software Product License. By explicitly
accepting this EULA  you are acknowledging and agreeing to be bound
by the following terms:

1. EVALUATION LICENSE WARNING

This Software Product can be used in conjunction with a free evaluation
Software Product License. If you are using such an evaluation Software
Product License, you may use the Software Product only to evaluate its
suitability for purchase. Evaluation Software Product Licenses have an
expiration date and most of the features of the software will be disabled
after that date. WINGWARE BEARS NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES
RESULTING FROM USE (OR ATTEMPTED USE AFTER THE EXPIRATION DATE) OF THE
SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AND HAS NO DUTY TO PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT BEFORE OR AFTER
THE EXPIRATION DATE OF AN EVALUATION LICENSE.

2. GRANT OF NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE

Wingware grants the non-exclusive, non-transferable right for a
single user to use this Software Product on a single operating system per
license purchased. Each additional concurrent user of the Software
Product, or each additional operating system where the product is used,
requires an additional Software Product License.  This includes operating
systems on which the Software Product is compiled from source code by the
user.

Wingware grants you the right to modify, alter, improve, or
enhance the Software Product without limitation, except as described
in this EULA.

Although rights to modification of the Software Product are granted by
this EULA, you may not tamper with, alter, or use the Software Product
in a way that disables, circumvents, or otherwise defeats its built-in 
licensing verification and enforcement capabilities.  The right to
modification of the Software Product also does not include the right to 
remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary
notice, legend, symbol or label in the Software Product.

You may at your discretion distribute patch files containing any
modifications or improvements made to the Software Product, other than
those that are aimed at disabling or circumventing its built-in license
verification capabilities, or that result in the removal or alteration
of any trademark, logo, copyright, or other proprietary notice, legend,
symbol or label in the Software Product.  This right does not include 
the right to distribute substantial portions of the original source, where 
distribution rights are limited to contextual information normally 
existing in software patch files.

You may at your discretion designate license terms, open source or
otherwise, for all modifications or improvements made by you.  
Wingware has no special rights to any such modifications or
improvements.

You may make copies of the Software Product as reasonably necessary for
its use. Each copy must reproduce all copyright and other proprietary
rights notices on or in the Software Product.

You may install each Software Product License on a single computer system.
A second installation of the same Software Product License may be made
on one other computer system, so long as both copies of the same Software
Product License never come into concurrent use.  You may also make copies of
the Software Product License as necessary for backup and/or archival
purposes.  Backup and archival copies may not come into active use,
together with the Software Product, for any purpose.  No other copies
may be made.  Each copy must reproduce all copyright and other proprietary
rights notices on or in the Software Product License. You may not modify
or create derivative copies of the Software Product License.

All rights not expressly granted to you are retained by WIngware.

2.1 EDUCATIONAL USE LICENSES

Wingware provides educational use licenses for the Software Product to
students and faculty of educational institutions.  When licensed at
the educational discount, the Software Product may not be used for 
any commercial purpose without first paying the price difference 
between the educational and commercial license for the Software 
Product.

3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS RESERVED BY WINGWARE

The Software Product is owned by Wingware and is protected by United
States and international copyright laws and treaties, as well as other
intellectual property laws and treaties. You must not remove or alter any
copyright notices on any copies of the Software Product. This Software
Product copy is licensed, not sold. You may not use, copy, or distribute
the Software Product, except as granted by this EULA, without written
authorization from Wingware or its designated agents.  Furthermore,
this EULA does not grant you any rights in connection with any trademarks
or service marks of Wingware.  Wingware reserves all intellectual property
rights, including copyrights, and trademark rights.

4. NO RIGHT TO TRANSFER

You may not rent, lease, lend, or in any way distribute or transfer any
rights in this EULA or the Software Product to third parties without
Wingware's written approval, and subject to written agreement by the
recipient of the terms of this EULA.

5. INDEMNIFICATION

You hereby agree to indemnify Wingware against and hold harmless Wingware
from any claims, lawsuits or other losses that arise out of your breach of
any provision of this EULA.

6. THIRD PARTY RIGHTS

Any software provided along with the Software Product that is associated
with a separate license agreement is licensed to you under the terms of
that license agreement.  This license does not apply to those portions
of the Software Product.  Copies of these third party licenses are included 
in all copies of the Software Product.

7. SUPPORT SERVICES

Wingware may provide you with support services related to the
Software Product. Use of any such support services is governed by
Wingware policies and programs described in online documentation
and/or other Wingware-provided materials.

As part of these support services, Wingware may make available bug
lists, planned feature lists, and other supplemental informational
materials.  WINGWARE MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FOR THESE
MATERIALS AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
ANY USE OF THESE MATERIALS.  FURTHERMORE, YOU MAY NOT USE ANY MATERIALS
PROVIDED IN THIS WAY TO SUPPORT ANY CLAIM MADE AGAINST WINGWARE.

Any supplemental software code or related materials that Wingware
provides to you as part of the support services, in periodic updates to
the Software Product or otherwise, is to be considered part of the
Software Product and is subject to the terms and conditions of this
EULA.

With respect to any technical information you provide to Wingware as
part of the support services, Wingware may use such information for
its business purposes without restriction, including for product support
and development.  Wingware will not use such technical information in
a form that personally identifies you without first obtaining your permission.

9. TERMINATION WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO ANY OTHER RIGHTS

Wingware may terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with any term
or condition of this EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of
the Software Product and Software Product Licenses.
