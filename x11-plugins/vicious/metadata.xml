		Vicious is a modular widget library for <pkg>x11-wm/awesome</pkg>,
		derived from the Wicked widget library. It has some of the old Wicked
		widget types, a few of them rewritten, and a good number of new widgets.

		With vicious you get only the framework to create your own stable
		configuration. Don't expect vicious to hold your hand. Don't even expect
		it to handle all errors. If you make a mistake your configuration can
		break. I encourage you to explore, and then modify each widget to suit
		your own needs.
