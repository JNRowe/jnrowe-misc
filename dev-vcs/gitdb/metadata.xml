		The GitDB project implements interfaces to allow read and write access
		to git repositories. In its core lies the db package, which contains all
		database types necessary to read a complete git repository. These are
		the LooseObjectDB, the PackedDB and the ReferenceDB which are combined
		into the GitDB to combine every aspect of the git database.

		For this to work, GitDB implements pack reading, as well as loose object
		reading and writing. Data is always encapsulated in streams, which
		allows huge files to be handled as well as small ones, usually only
		chunks of the stream are kept in memory for processing, never the whole
		stream at once.

		Interfaces are used to describe the API, making it easy to provide
		alternate implementations.
