		"git-sync" is a tool to keep multiple git repositories up-to-date with
		their upstream reposito‚Äê ries, and to clone new repositories as they are
		added to the upstream location.

		The updating is done in a manner which preserves your local state, and
		should not cause conflicts.  A "git remote update --prune" is always
		done; if the user has no uncommitted changes, and the merge would be
		a fast-forward, the current branch is "git pull"ed, and the diffstat is
		printed.  Otherwise, the state of the repository is shown in a concise
		manner.

		"git-sync" also understands "git-svn" clones, and updates them using the
		same rules, but using "git svn fetch" and "git svn rebase" instead of
		"git remote update" and "git pull".
