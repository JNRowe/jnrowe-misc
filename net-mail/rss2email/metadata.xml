		rss2email lets you read newsfeeds from a program that you already know
		and use everyday: your email client. So rather than having to learn to
		use a new program or visit a webpage, rss2email delivers news items to
		the place where information that is important to you already is.

		Your email client probably has useful filtering capabilities. Rather
		than be bombarded by every new item, you can sort and group feeds into
		different folders so that the important stuff gets read first and other
		things stick around until later.

		Also, if you find something that you want to hang onto or foward to a
		friend, you probably already know how to do that in your email client.
