		Sunwait is a small C program for calculating sunrise and sunset, as well
		as civil, nautical, and astronomical twilights. It has features that
		make it useful for home automation tasks.

		The feature that makes this program slightly unique is that it can be
		set to wait specific event (such as 5 minutes before sunrise), then
		exit. This makes it useful for 'cron' jobs or 'scheduled tasks' when you
		want something to happen relative to sunrise, sunset, or some other
		astronomical event.
