		repl wraps a non-interactive command in an interactive
		read-eval-print-loop prompt. Each line you type into the prompt
		is executed as arguments to command. Anything written to
		standard output or standard error by the command is displayed.

		If you have <pkg>app-misc/rlwrap</pkg> installed you'll
		automatically get the full benefits of readline: history,
		reverse searches, etc.

		repl is meant to wrap programs which accept command line
		arguments and print to the standard output. It keeps no state
		between executed lines and, as such, cannot be used to replace
		irb or the Python REPL (for example).
