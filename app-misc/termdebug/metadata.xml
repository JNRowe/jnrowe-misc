		Termdebug is a set of utilities to record and replay the input and
		output of a terminal program. Its main goal is to aid in developing and
		debugging terminal programs. Other programs such as termrec/termplay,
		nethack-recorder/player and script/scriptreplay only record the output.
		However, when debugging an interactive terminal program, the input is
		often more important than the output.
