		Everyone I know prefers to work with JSON over XML, but sadly there is
		a sore lack of utilities of the quality or depth of html-xml-utils and
		XMLStarlet for actually processing JSON data in an automated fashion,
		short of writing an ad hoc processor in your favourite programming
		language.

		jsonpipe is a step towards a solution: it traverses a JSON object and
		produces a simple, line-based textual format which can be processed by
		all your UNIX favourites like grep, sed, awk, cut and diff. It may also
		be valuable within programming languages---in fact, it was originally
		conceived as a way of writing simple test assertions against JSON output
		without coupling the tests too closely to the specific structure used.

		This implementation (which should be considered the reference) is
		written in Python.
