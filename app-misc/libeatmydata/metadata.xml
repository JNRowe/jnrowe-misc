		<!-- from Debian's control file, thanks! -->
		This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and
		a couple of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and
		friends (like open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software
		that writes data safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software
		no longer crash safe. 

		You will find eatmydata useful if particular software calls fsync(),
		sync() etc. frequently but the data it stores is not that valuable to
		you and you may afford losing it in case of system crash. Data-to-disk
		synchronization calls are typically very slow on modern file systems and
		their extensive usage might slow down software significantly. It does
		not make sense to accept such a hit in performance if data being
		manipulated is not very important. 

		On the other hand, do not use eatmydata when you care about what
		software stores or it manipulates important components of your system.
		The library is called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.
