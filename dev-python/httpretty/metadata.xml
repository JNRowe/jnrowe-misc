		HTTPretty is a HTTP client mock library for Python 100% inspired
		by <pkg>dev-ruby/fakeweb</pkg>.

		HTTPretty monkey matches Python's socket core module,
		reimplementing the HTTP protocol, by mocking requests and
		responses.

		As for it works in this way, you don't need to worry what http
		library you're gonna use.

		HTTPretty will mock the response for you :) (and also give you
		the latest requests so that you can check them)
