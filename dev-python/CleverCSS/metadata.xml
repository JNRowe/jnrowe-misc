		CleverCSS is a small markup language for CSS inspired by Python that can
		be used to build a style sheet in a clean and structured way. In many
		ways it's cleaner and more powerful than CSS2 is.

		The most obvious difference to CSS is the syntax: it is indentation
		based and not flat. While this is obviously against the Python Zen, it's
		nonetheless a good idea for structural styles.
