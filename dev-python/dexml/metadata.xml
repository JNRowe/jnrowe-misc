		Let's face it: xml is a fact of modern life. I'd even go so far as to
		say that it's good at what is does. But that doesn't mean it's easy to
		work with and it doesn't mean that we have to like it. Most of the time,
		XML just needs to get the hell out of the way and let you do some actual
		work instead of writing code to traverse and manipulate yet another DOM.

		The dexml module takes the obvious mapping between XML tags and Python
		objects and lets you capture that as cleanly as possible. Loosely
		inspired by Django's ORM, you write simple class definitions to define
		the expected structure of your XML document.
