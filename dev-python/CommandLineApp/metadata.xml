		CommandLineApp is a base class for command line programs. It handles the
		repetitive aspects of interacting with the user on the command line such
		as parsing options and arguments, generating help messages, error
		handling, and printing status messages. To create your application, just
		make a subclass of CommandLineApp and concentrate on your own code. All
		of the information about switches, arguments, and help text necessary
		for your program to run is derived through introspection. Common options
		and behavior can be shared by applications through inheritance.
