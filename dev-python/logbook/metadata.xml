		Logbook is a logging sytem for Python that replaces the standard
		libraryâ€™s logging module. It was designed for complex and simple
		applications in mind.

		This library is still under heavy development and the API is not fully
		finalized yet. Feedback is appreciated. The docs here only show a tiny,
		tiny feature set and are terribly incomplete. We will have better docs
		soon, but until then we hope this gives a sneak peak about how cool
		Logbook is. If you want more, have a look at the comprehensive
		testsuite.
