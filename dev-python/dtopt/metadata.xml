		When using the doctest module it is often convenient to use the
		ELLIPSIS option, which allows you to use ... as a wildcard. But you
		either have to setup the test runner to use this option, or you must put
		#doctest:

			+ELLIPSIS on every example that uses this feature.

		dtopt lets you enable this option globally from within a doctest, by
		doing:

			&gt;&gt;&gt; from dtopt import ELLIPSIS

		(The options NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE and COMPARE are also available)
