		upoints is a collection of GPL v3 licensed modules for working
		with points on Earth, or other near spherical objects.  It allows you to
		calculate the distance and bearings between points, mangle
		xearth_/xplanet_ data files, work with online UK trigpoint databases,
		NOAA's weather station database and other such location databases.

		Previous versions of upoints were called earth_distance, but the
		name was changed as it no longer reflected the majority of uses the
		packages was targeted at.
