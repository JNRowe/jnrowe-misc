		straight.plugin is a Python plugin loader inspired by
		twisted.plugin with two important distinctions:

		- Fewer dependencies
		- Python 3 compatible

		The system is used to allow multiple Python packages to provide
		plugins within a namespace package, where other packages will
		locate and utilize. The plugins themselves are modules in a
		namespace package where the namespace identifies the plugins in
		it for some particular purpose or intent.

		For example, if I was building a log parser, I might tell users
		that he parser will look for plugins in the `logfilter`
		namespace. Someone else could then provide a module named
		`logfilter.normalizedates` and my parser would find this plugin,
		load it, and use it to filter the log entries.
