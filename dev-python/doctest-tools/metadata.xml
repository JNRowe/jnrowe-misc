		These are a small set of tools to make it easier to run doctest on your
		source files and text files. 

		There is a tool to run doctest on an individual file, and another tool
		to run doctest on all files within a directory (recursively). The
		individual doctest runs are done in separate processes so that the tests
		don't contaminate each other. 

		Finally, there is a small module to set the python path of the program
		calling it to make it easier to run the program from multiple clones of
		the same project where it is impossible to set the python path to
		a single location. 

		These tools are written in Python so that they will run on all platforms
		with Python 2.5 through Python 3.
