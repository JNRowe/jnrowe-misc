		Schematics is an easy way to model data. It provides mechanisms for
		structuring data, initializing data, serializing data, formatting data
		and validating data against type definitions, like an email address.

		The library provides data types, in the form of fields. Each field
		controls the details of how its data should look in various formats. It
		also provides a validate() function which is responsible for determining
		if the data looks correct.

		Schematics' main goal is to provide similar functionality to a type
		system along with a way to generate the schematics we send to the
		Internet, or store in a database, or send to some Java process, or
		basically any use case with structured data.
