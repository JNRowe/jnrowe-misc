		nose-pathmunge is a plugin to the <pkg>dev-python/nose</pkg> test
		framework which provides a method to add directories to the sys.path of
		nose, which is inherited by the tests running within nose.

		This itch stems from in many of my own cases, the need to add modules to
		a given run (dependencies) that I don't want to install because they're
		synced from a source control system, and change frequently.

		This plugin is extremely simple. It's meant to be.
