		Makes ANSI escape character sequences for producing colored terminal
		text work under MS Windows.

		ANSI escape character sequences have long been used to produce colored
		terminal text on Unix and Macs. Colorama makes this work on Windows,
		too. It also provides some shortcuts to help generate ANSI sequences,
		and works fine in conjunction with any other ANSI sequence generation
		library, such as Termcolor (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor.)

		This has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for
		printing colored terminal text from Python, and has the happy
		side-effect that existing applications or libraries which use ANSI
		sequences to produce colored output on Linux or Macs can now also work
		on Windows, simply by calling colorama.init().
