		A thin, practical wrapper around terminal formatting, positioning, and
		more.

		Blessings lifts several of curses' limiting assumptions, and it makes
		your code pretty, too:

		* Use styles, color, and maybe a little positioning without clearing the
		  whole screen first.
		* Leave more than one screenful of scrollback in the buffer after your
		  program exits, like a well-behaved command-line app should.
		* Get rid of all those noisy, C-like calls to tigetstr and tparm, so
		  your code doesn't get crowded out by terminal bookkeeping.
		* Act intelligently when somebody redirects your output to a file,
		  omitting the terminal control codes the user doesn't want to see
		  (optional).
