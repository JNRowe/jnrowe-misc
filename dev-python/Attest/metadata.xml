		Attest is a unit testing framework built from the ground up with
		idiomatic Python in mind. Unlike others, it is not built on top
		of unittest though it provides compatibility by creating
		TestSuites from Attest collections.

		It has a functional API inspired by <pkg>dev-python/flask</pkg>
		and a class-based API that mimics Python itself. The core avoids
		complicated assumptions leaving you free to write tests however
		you prefer.
