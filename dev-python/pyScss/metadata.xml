		pyScss compiles Scss (Sass), a superset of CSS that is more
		powerful, elegant and easier to maintain than plain-vanilla
		CSS. The library acts as a CSS source code preprocesor which
		allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, and have
		inheritance of rules, all with a CSS-compatible syntax which the
		preprocessor then compiles to standard CSS.

		Scss, as an extension of CSS, helps keep large stylesheets
		well-organized. It borrows concepts and functionality from
		projects such as OOCSS and other similar frameworks like as
		Sass. It's build on top of the original PHP xCSS codebase
		structure but it's been completely rewritten, many bugs have
		been fixed and it has been extensively extended to support
		almost the full range of Sass' Scss syntax and functionality.
