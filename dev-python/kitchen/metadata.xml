		We've all done it. In the process of writing a brand new application
		we've discovered that we need a little bit of code that we've invented
		before. Perhaps it's something to handle unicode text. Perhaps it's
		something to make a bit of python-2.5 code run on python-2.3. Whatever
		it is, it ends up being a tiny bit of code that seems too small to worry
		about pushing into its own module so it sits there, a part of your
		current project, waiting to be cut and pasted into your next project.
		And the next. And the next. And since that little bittybit of code
		proved so useful to you, it's highly likely that it proved useful to
		someone else as well. Useful enough that they've written it and copy and
		pasted it over and over into each of their new projects.

		Well, no longer! Kitchen aims to pull these small snippets of code into
		a few python modules which you can import and use within your project.
		No more copy and paste! Now you can let someone else maintain and
		release these small snippets so that you can get on with your life.
