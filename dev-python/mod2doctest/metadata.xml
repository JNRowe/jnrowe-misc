		mod2doctest is a module that converts a python module to a doctest
		compatible docstring.

		It's kind of like taking a python script, pasting it into an interactive
		interpreter and then copying the output back into a docstring.

		With mod2doctest you can set up a test the "quick and dirty" way -- just
		by making a module that tests your code, running it, and then inspecting
		the output. Then, you can use mod2doctest to take a snapshot of the
		output and convert it to a permanent test fixture.

		Also has many convenience to make this process easier like adding
		ellipse markers for memory id / trace back and provides several
		formating features.
