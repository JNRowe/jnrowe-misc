		Shells are applications often used by administrators or developers to
		carry out very diverse type of operations: the list is virtually
		boundless and includes, for example, disk management, network
		administration, source code version control, or application packaging
		and deployment. Documentation of shell operations are eased by the
		fact that a shell session is composed of text commands and outputs,
		which is easy to copy and paste, or to present orderly.

		Wordish is a project which parses a shell session from a documentation
		which contains the commands and the expected output, and verifies that
		they work exactly as shown, to make sure the documentation is correct.
