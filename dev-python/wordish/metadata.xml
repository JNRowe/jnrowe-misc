		Wordish is a script which executes a shell session parsed from
		a documentation in the restructured text [1] format, then tests and
		builds a report of the execution. To mark up shell code in an article,
		wordish uses the custom directive sourcecode, with the required argument
		sh. When presented with an article:

		* wordish filters out the text which is not marked with sourcecode,
		* then, separates the blocks of shell codes between commands and
		  outputs:
			* wordish consumes the prompt, parses for the newline which ends
			  command,
			* then parses for the prompt which ends the output,
