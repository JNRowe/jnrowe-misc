# tests are unfortunately broken in this release, and this package is already

RESTRICT="test"

# tl;dr This package is masked on genesis, because it bundles libs
#
# Unfortunately, this package bundles slightly modified versions of pep8 and
# pyflakes.  Stripping the bundling and monkey patching in the changes will be
# a huge maintenance burden, so we'll try to live with it for the time being as
# this package never hits a deploy platform.

# setuptools is an optional dependency for setup.py, but favour reproducibilty
# as installation varies when it is available.
