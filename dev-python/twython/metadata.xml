		Twython was started because the author found that other Python Twitter
		libraries weren't that up to date. Certain things like the Search API,
		OAuth, etc, don't seem to be fully covered. This is his attempt at
		a library that offers more coverage.

		OAuth and Streaming API support is in the works, but every other part of
		the Twitter API should be covered. Twython handles both Basic (HTTP)
		Authentication and OAuth (Older versions (pre 0.9) of Twython need Basic
		Auth specified - to override this, specify 'authtype="Basic"' in your
		twython.setup() call).
