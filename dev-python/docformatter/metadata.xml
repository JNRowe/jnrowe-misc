		docformatter currently automatically formats docstrings to follow
		a subset of the PEP 257 conventions. Below are the relevant items quoted
		from PEP 257.

		* For consistency, always use triple double quotes around docstrings.
		* Triple quotes are used even though the string fits on one line.
		* Multi-line docstrings consist of a summary line just like a one-line
		  docstring, followed by a blank line, followed by a more elaborate
		  description.
		* The BDFL recommends inserting a blank line between the last paragraph in
		  a multi-line docstring and its closing quotes, placing the closing
		  quotes on a line by themselves.
