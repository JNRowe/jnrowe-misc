		nose-progressive is a <pkg>dev-python/nose</pkg> plugin which displays
		progress in a stationary progress bar, freeing the rest of the screen
		(as well as the scrollback buffer) for the compact display of test
		failures, which it formats beautifully and usefully. It displays
		failures and errors as soon as they occur and avoids scrolling them off
		the screen in favor of less useful output. It also offers a number of
		other human-centric features to speed the debugging process.
