		Aaargh is a <pkg>dev-lang/python</pkg> module that makes building
		friendly command line applications really easy. Applications built with
		Aaargh provide a single executable with a subcommand for each exposed
		Python function.  Each subcommand may have its own command line
		arguments. This is similar to the way version control systems provide
		multiple commands using a single entry point. (Examples include bzr
		commit and git checkout).

		Aaargh is named after one of the castles in the movie Monty Python and
		the Holy Grail. The acronym Aaargh stands for an astonishingly awesome
		application argument helper, but omits a few letters to make it triple
		A.

		Aaargh is compatible with both Python 2.6+ and Python 3.
