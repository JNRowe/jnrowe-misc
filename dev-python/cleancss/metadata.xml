		CleanCSS is a simple pythonic language for CSS inspired by CleverCSS but
		simpler and with less obstrusive features.

		Massimiliano Torromeo really liked the idea behind CleverCSS but when
		used in production I realized that I was trying to get away from its
		parser by escaping strings and unsupported CSS properties way too often.
		Using vendor prefixes like -webkit-gradient and values such as rgba
		resulted in a messy CSS, so I decided to write my own parser for
		a similar syntax without all the complex features that I did not use
		anyway and it now works fine for me in REAL modern websites.
