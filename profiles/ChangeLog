  16 Jun 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask, use.local.desc:
  Removed x11-plugins/vicious.  Users should've be attempting to migrate to
  upstream ebuilds.

  02 Jun 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Masked
  x11-themes/notify-osd-icons for removal.  Of little use without notify-osd.

  02 Jun 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Removed notify-osd,
  it really is unsupportable.  Luckily this was never unmasked, so doesn't need
  a grace period.

  23 May 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> use.local.desc: Added proxy support
  to github2.

  17 May 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Masked vicious for
  removal.  The maintenance burden of shadowing an upstream ebuild is too high,
  for too little gain.  Sorry, if you have trouble migrating.

  10 May 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Removed gistapi.
  Masked for removal because the dependencies in new releases are unsupportable.

  Better alternatives exist, including busyboxs fbsplash and plymouth. Closes
  #141.

  ebuild.  Closes #290.

  16 Feb 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Revert "Masked

  87ec92935d1a812b9a3ca7c508dde664c2ef2c53.  Nathan wants gruffy saved, so this
  must stay for the time being.

  13 Feb 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask:  Masked
  media-gfx/pgmagick for removal on 2011-03-15.  The process this package was
  used for has been rewritten.  The package imposes a significant maintenance
  burden for no real use, and is set for removal.  If you do use it speak up
  soon!

  29 Jan 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Masked restview for
  removal.

  27 Jan 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Masked psplash for

  08 Jan 2011; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> categories, updates/1Q-2011: Moved

  includes command line functionality.

  06 Dec 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> use.local.desc: Regenerated
  use.local.desc.

  05 Dec 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Removed python-gnupg.
  Alternatives exist, maintenance burden too high.

  04 Dec 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> use.local.desc: Regenerated
  use.local.desc.  Broken mtime check in builder caused this not to be added
  when vicious was updated.

  Cost of supporting too high, plenty of alternatives.

  23 Nov 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> categories: Initial libeatmydata

  08 Oct 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Initial notify-osd

  up if you want it to stay!

  25 Aug 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> use.local.desc: Renamed id3 USE
  flag to id3tag in castget.  It is the more common name throughout the tree for

  ebuild for castget.

  disabling winwrangler's gtkhotkey daemon.

  04 Apr 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: dev-util/be finally

  buggy for everyday use.  Alternatives to Bugs Everywhere such as ditz exist.

  30 Mar 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> use.local.desc: Made the
  use.local.desc header a little more meaningful.

  30 Mar 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Added tool to

  12 Mar 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Removed obsolete

  is unsupportable in its current state.

  ebuild.

  27 Feb 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: wingide finally
  removed.  The upstream packaging is a shocking mess.  Both versions supported
  by the ebuilds contain bundled releases of Python and GTK+ with easily
  exploitable security vulnerabilities, and only the GTK+ problems are easily
  worked around.  After some months, nobody has stepped up to maintain the
  ebuilds beyond one-off bugfixes.

  16 Feb 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: wordish-1.0.0_beta4
  version bump.

  masked.  The snapshot is incompatible with the newest upstream sources, and
  the new code is neither released or an improvement.

  30 Jan 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> package.mask: Masked subtle for
  removal.

  20 Jan 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> categories: unionfs-fuse ebuilds
  have moved to ::fixes. There is now a version in the tree, and the ebuilds
  will still exist in ::fixes until a version has equal keywords.  See AST
  #249971 for some unfortunate details of the upgrade path.

  14 Jan 2010; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> categories: Initial pyhumod ebuild.

  dev-util/wingide-3.2.2 version bump.

  01 Dec 2009; James Rowe <jnrowe@gmail.com> categories: Resynced categories.
