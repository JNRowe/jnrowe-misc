		LuaSocket is a Lua extension library that is composed by two parts:
		a C core that provides support for the TCP and UDP transport layers, and
		a set of Lua modules that add support for functionality commonly needed
		by applications that deal with the Internet.

		The core support has been implemented so that it is both efficient and
		simple to use. It is available to any Lua application once it has been
		properly initialized by the interpreter in use. The code has been tested
		and runs well on several Windows and Unix platforms. 

		Among the support modules, the most commonly used implement the SMTP
		(sending e-mails), HTTP (WWW access) and FTP (uploading and downloading
		files) client protocols. These provide a very natural and generic
		interface to the functionality defined by each protocol. In addition,
		you will find that the MIME (common encodings), URL (anything you could
		possible want to do with one) and LTN12 (filters, sinks, sources and
		pumps) modules can be very handy.
