		sxiv is an alternative to feh and qiv. Its only dependency
		besides xlib is imlib2. The primary goal for writing sxiv is to
		create an image viewer, which only has the most basic features
		required for fast image viewing (the ones I want). It works
		nicely with tiling window managers and its code base should be
		kept small and clean to make it easy for you to dig into it and
		customize it for your needs.
