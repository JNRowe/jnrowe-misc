		This tool allows you to search, index and record/stream:

		* BBC iPlayer TV - up to 3200 kbps HD 720p H.264 / Quicktime / MP4
		* BBC Live TV - 500 kbps H.264 / MP4
		* BBC iPlayer Radio - up to 192 kbps MP3 / AAC and Realaudio
		* BBC Live Radio - up to 192 kbps MP3 / AAC, WMA and Realaudio
		* BBC Podcasts - up to 192 kbps MP3 / AAC
		* BBC iPlayer TV subtitles - SubRip / srt

		Unlike the web sites, get_iplayer has PVR-like capabilities (like Sky+
		/ TiVo / Series-Link); You can save lists of programme searches which
		are automatically recorded when they become available so that you can
		watch them when you choose and on devices that cannot run Adobe Flash
		Player - even if you donâ€™t have adequate broadband speeds or if your
		broadband streams too slowly at peak hours when you want to watch
		a programme.
