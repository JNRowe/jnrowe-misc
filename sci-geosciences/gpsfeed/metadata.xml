		gpsfeed+ is a utility that feeds the PC with continuous GPS data as if
		a GPS were moving in a car or airplane. NMEA 0183 GPS sentences are sent
		to the application through a socket (TCP/IP) connection or a UDP
		multicast message. It also outputs the same NMEA data to a serial port
		of the PC. Polling applications can query the embedded lightweight http
		server to obtain gps data either in text form or as an XML data snippet. 

		The IP connection offers significant advantages over a serial port
		connection:

		* many applications can connect to one single gps simultaneously
		* remote gps' can be monitored
		* Serial ports can be freed for other uses. In most cases, the only
		  readily available and simple I/O interface is the RS232 connector.
		* and, of course, testing can be done indoors, without any GPS hardware
		  or cabling
