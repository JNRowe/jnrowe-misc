Contribution checklist
======================

Before submitting your pull request, please ask yourself the following
questions:

1. Did you follow the advice in the devmanual_?
2. Did you follow the advice in the ``jnrowe-misc`` `contributing doc`_?
3. Have you run your package manager's QA tool on your changes? [#]_
4. Do your commit messages explain the changes you're making?

If you can't follow these guidelines then open a pull request anyway, but be
prepared to add a cookie to sweeten the deal ;)

.. [#] ``repoman`` with ``portage``, ``pcheck`` with ``pkgcore``, etc.
