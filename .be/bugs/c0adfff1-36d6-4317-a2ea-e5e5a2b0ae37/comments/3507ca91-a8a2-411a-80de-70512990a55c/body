  Hmm, net-news is surely the right category as it where every other
feed reader is located.  Why not just keep it there?

  The ebuild in the tree is really quite broken too, so maybe it would
make more sense to just scrub it in the local syncs.  And by quite
broken I mean installs python code in to /usr/share, DEPEND on
feedparser, hardcoded patch versioning, doexe calls to /usr/bin, ...
