  I'd prefer to, but unless upstream move to net-news it isn't staying
where it is.  It just isn't worth the grief.  It is already moved in the
pending branch by the way, I just haven't merged and pushed master yet.

  Submit patches upstream then, as that is the correct solution.
I definitely agree about the /usr/share thing because being unable to
import the Feed objects without path games will break my setup ;)  The
others are mostly uninteresting.  As far as I'm aware portage still
forces RDEPEND before merge anyhow so that is a non-issue and the patch
versioning may well change the first time a bump is required.
