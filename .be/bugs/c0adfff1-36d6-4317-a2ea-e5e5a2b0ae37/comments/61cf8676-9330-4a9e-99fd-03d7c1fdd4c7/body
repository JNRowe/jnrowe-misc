  Okay I will if I get some free time, I just don't see patches going
anywhere when it is for stuff like this.  It would have been a lot less
work if the ebuilds had been submitted in the original bug.

  I'd argue against them being uninteresting by the way, it means we've
got to run around adding build rules to ignore QA warnings in
a previously clean package.  I do see why they'd be less interesting
to some however, especially if you only test with portage/repoman.
