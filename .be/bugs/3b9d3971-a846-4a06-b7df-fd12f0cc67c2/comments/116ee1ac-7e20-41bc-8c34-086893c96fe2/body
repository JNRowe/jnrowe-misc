  I've updated the test suite a lot, the graph code is at 95% now.
Unfortunately, I've had to futz around with the API a little too.  The
old stuff is still supported with -DDEPRECATED, which I've set as the
default, but if nothing else is using it please invert it and the drop
the unused code.

  Done.  It specifically handles multiple renames well too, and if you
have javascript enabled it even tells you the previous names and dates
they moved on rollover.
