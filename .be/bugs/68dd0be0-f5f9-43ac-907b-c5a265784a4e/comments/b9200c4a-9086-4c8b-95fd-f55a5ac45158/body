As fleshed out with Matt we should add a generic wrapper script for
python modules that require setuptools in RDEPEND just for a script, so
that they can be removed.

This makes much more sense than duplicating the code all over the place
as is currently happening, and a specific wrapper would be useful than
the nasty hack with make_wrapper_script too.
