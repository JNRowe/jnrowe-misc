Even though ``use.local.desc`` is now generated this doesn't solve the
problem that no commonly used search tools seem to support
``use.local.desc`` from overlays.  Beyond suggesting users install
msearch, which Paul hasn't released publicly, or recommending paludis
with the ``--show-use-descriptions`` option there is little that can be
done by users to who wish to see the data.  See `Gentoo bug #184091
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184091>`_ for the status of
``app-portage/euses`` which seems to be a popular choice for searching
``USE`` flags.
