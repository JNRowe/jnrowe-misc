  You have pull rights now ;)

  I should state that was always the intent of this overlay, it has just
been a touch difficult to merge some of the trees because of licensing
problems as in this case but often because the ebuilds depend on package
manager hacks that aren't supported by portage.

  I understand the sentiment but unfortunately it isn't that simple, as
the plugin manager source isn't publicly available.  It is about time
somebody, perhaps you, wrote a free replacement or mangled the tree to
work with Debian's vim-addon-manager if that is a viable replacement.
