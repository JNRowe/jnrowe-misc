  I don't think so.  The package is tested enough that it is gets
keyworded, and also one version or another have been included in
final product releases.  Those versions would at least need to be kept
around for build support, therefore I don't think it makes much sense to
drop them completely.

  It has happened once, beyond having to occasionally rediff the build
fixes patch that is.
