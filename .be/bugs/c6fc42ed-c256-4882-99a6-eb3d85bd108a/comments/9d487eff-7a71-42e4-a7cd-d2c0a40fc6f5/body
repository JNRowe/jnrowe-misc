Actually, would it be possible to add a "live" snapshot ebuild instead?
What I'm thinking of is an ebuild that pulls the current $number
snapshot and builds that.  It would bypass the subversion problem, but
it would obviously use more bandwidth.

Is that sort of thing easy to do?  I can't seem to find any examples of
it.
