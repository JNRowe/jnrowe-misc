Rach,

  I looked at your puzzles-live branch earlier, and it definitely looks
like a sane way to manage the ebuild.  I'm just not sure I want to merge
it to master because of the subversion dependency, and I've not uet
decided on the appropriate action.  The options are basically:

  * Merge it with master, and break the testing policies as subversion
    can't be installed on most of the test systems
  * Merge it in to a tracking branch, with an explicit note that it is
    master plus possibly untested packages.
  * Kick them along with some other live ebuilds in to a distinct, lower
    QA, repo.

  Thoughts?

  If you switch back to the idea of "live" ebuild with the snapshots
then it can definitely be merged as a masked to master, the choice about
how this eventually resolves is mostly up to you.
