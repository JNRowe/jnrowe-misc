The snapshots are only generated from the subversion tree, so a live
ebuild is unlikely to be much less stable than the snapshots.  Maybe
just drop the snapshot ebuilds and more solely to a live ebuild?

How often are snapshots unsuitable for bumping?  What do you use to test
the games?

That is a good point.  I'll take a look this week.
