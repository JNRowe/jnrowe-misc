Rach,

  And in future I'd prefer pull/review requests to have an associated
comment in the bug, I just find it simpler to manage them that way.  It
isn't so important for this tree as it is small, but for other larger
trees it becomes much more important.

  Before you point it out I know it *wasn't* documented before, but that
has been solved now too.

Thanks
